Number Guessing Game

Description

The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based Python program where players try to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. The game offers two difficulty levels:

Easy: 10 attempts to guess the correct number.

Hard: 5 attempts to guess the correct number.

The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, helping players refine their guesses until they win or run out of attempts.

How to Play

Run the Python script.

Choose a difficulty level by typing easy or hard when prompted.

Enter your guesses when asked.

Receive feedback after each guess:

If the guess is too high or too low, you will be prompted to guess again.

If the guess is correct, the game ends with a success message.

If you run out of attempts, the correct answer is revealed.
